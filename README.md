PROBLEM STATEMENT:

Improving Productivity

Working from home — some people love it; other people hate it. Regardless of which camp you fall into, you’re likely spending an increased amount of time in the confines of your own home these days.

Even before the coronavirus was impacting our physical work environment, the number of telecommuters had been steadily ticking up. According to Global Workplace Analytics, telecommuting has grown 173% since 2005, with 4.7 million people now working at least part time from home.

Can you create something that can boost productivity, help in staying connected and boost team’s morale while working from home?
